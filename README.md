# Word-Guess-Game

This project is a game of Seattle Seahawks themed hangman, developed using plain Javascript.

The user engages with the game by guessing letters through keyboard input to try to spell out the name of a Seahawk player. 
If the player guesses a letter incorrectly, a guess is deducted.
The player wins when they uncover the entire surname of the player.
The player loses when they run out of spare guesses.

The number of starting guesses is determined based on the number of letters in the target name and the chosen difficulty level.

The player can choose whether to include "Legacy" Seahawk players, or only "Modern Era" Seahawk players. (Active Seahawks in 2012 or later).

Changing the difficulty level or the "Legacy/Modern Era" setting will result in the game being reset. The user will be prompted of this first.

Three hints are available if the user wants to use them. They are:
1. The player's first name.
2. The player's Seahawk career season span.
3. The player's football position.
If two or three hints are used, the win will not count. 

When the game ends, a reset button will appear, and the player can initiate a new game if they want.
